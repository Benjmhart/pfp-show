# Purely Functional Pleasantries (working title)

a show about Haskell and functional programming with Jonathan Lorimer and Ben Hart


## show outline
role leader just focuses on the content
role admin handles intro and outro,  and asks questions during the lesson to keep things simple & accessible.
so
admin: Show & host intros/announcements
leader leads discussion on topic
admin: show outro, reminders (subscribe, patreon, etc)
and we essentially trade off

## screenshare strategies
1) have some linux server on AWS or linode or something and use tmux for collab - so we can both jump back and forth on the keyboard (Tmux did the multi-user session thing way before vscode/google docs
2)  vscode live session
3) literally just swap whose screen is being shown (edited)
